# Getting Started

The `./bin/` directory contains a number of scripts which will help you get started:

 - `lint.sh` - lint the codebase to ensure quality
 - `readthedocs.sh` - generate and serve the project's documentation
 - `run.sh` - run the project itself
 - `setUpEnv.sh` - installs dependencies for the project

## Quickstart

 `bin/setUpEnv.sh && bin/run.sh`
